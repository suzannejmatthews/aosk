## Protecting Yourself Against Packet Sniffers

So how do we protect ourselves against packet sniffing? The answer is not to 
simply use password protected wireless networks. Someone who is intent on 
stealing your data will likely break the password. Once they are in the 
network, they can then run the packet sniffer and your information will be lost.
So what do we do? The answer is to use encryption whenever possible!

Encryption algorithms are based on really hard computer science problems 
that will take an incredibly long time to brute force. Consequently, 
this is considered the only truly “safe” way to transmit packets. Banks, online 
stores, and other entities that deal with financial transactions on a regular 
basis encrypt the packets being sent to them. That is why you always connect to 
an https address with them.

There have been several high profile cases involving packet sniffing that has 
occurred in decade. You can read more about them at the end of this tutorial. 
However, one of the positive outcomes of these highly public cases is that a 
lot of websites are using encryption by default. 

An easy way to check if your connection is encrypted is to look at the URL. 
If it starts with "https://" that means it is encrypted. In browsers such as 
Chrome, look for the little green lock and the words "secure". That lets us 
know that encryption is on.

Remember that if someone really wants to steal your information, they 
will try hard. There are a lot of malicious actors who are actively looking 
for vulnerabilities in TLS (the security layer that defines https).

Keep in mind that connecting to a site using encryption only protects your data 
as it is in transit to that site. If a site is hacked, or if the owner of the 
website decides to share your information with third parties, your personal 
information can still be compromised.

## Protecting Your Data

The most reliable way to ensure that your data never gets stolen on the internet is 
to not use the internet. But, of course, this is not a reasonable or feasible 
course of action! To maximize the security of your personal data, follow these essential tips.

1. **Never share anything online that you don't want everyone knowing**. Be 
   careful about what information you share on social media. This is not 
   limited to text! Since perfect copies can be made of all digital content, 
   be cautious about what photos and videos you upload or share as well.

2. **Regularly Check your Social Media Security Settings**. Lock down your 
   social media accounts so that only real friends (aka, people you know in 
   real life) can access them. Some websites reset your security settings on 
   updates, so it is a good idea to periodically check and ensure that they are 
   where you want them to be. Be sure to read the Terms of Service (TOS) of 
   whatever social media site you use. Nothing online is truly free -- understand 
   who owns and how they may use your data!

3. **Reduce your social media footprint**. Be careful about which "friend" requests 
   you accept, and who is following you on twitter. Turn off GPS location posting 
   on social media. If people know that you are in Hawaii, they know you aren't 
   home! Remember, once it is online your information is there forever! It is 
   extremely hard to remove content from the internet once it is there. 

4. **Use encryption whenever possible.** Use https as much as possible when you 
   search the web. Consider turning on encryption on your phone, laptop, or 
   other devices you may own.
