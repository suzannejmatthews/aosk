John the Ripper is a software tool used for password cracking. It is free and runs on the most common platforms. There is a free version of this software, which is frequently used. If the user needs an enhanced version of this software, there are available versions for purchase. This software brings many password crackers and hash types detectors in one package. Some of the hashes that John can crack are based on DES, Blowfish, or MD5. The newest types of hash functions are Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) and SHA-2 families. In general, John cracks weak hashes. There are two types of attacks attached to John. The dictionary attack takes string samples, usually from a wordlist (dictionary) containing passwords cracked before, encrypts them in the same format as the password being checked and compares the output to the password. The second type of attack is the brute force attack. For this one, John goes through all the possible plaintexts, hashes and compares them to the given password. One useful tool for this attack is the character frequency table. If the password contains more frequently used characters then it would take less time to crack the hash. This method is useful when the password is not in found in wordlists. The downside is the longer runtime. 

Passwords are not stored in plain text. They are encrypted using asymmetric hash functions. A hash is a function that transforms the input into an encoded string of characters with fixed length. The function behaves like a normal mathematical function, transforming the input. The difference is that a hash function makes the reverse impossible unless the function is known. A common attack on such an encryption is a rainbow table. 

You can use WinRTGen to create your own rainbow table. A rainbow table is essential a special wordlist that you create for a specific type of hash. Since in the previous years, the passwords have been improved, the common wordlist will probably fail, assuming that a person does not uses simple passwords anymore. Generating a new rainbow table requires a good computer configuration, depending on how big the table would be and the type of hash used. 

In this tutorial we will use John the Ripper to crack the password of a .zip file, using a dictionary attack. Our owner, Gerry, downloads a file from his e-mail. Using Wireshark, Ruby is able to capture the packets that form the file. Wireshark has a built-in function that allows the user to recreate a file. We will, first, recreate the file and, then we will crack its password.
