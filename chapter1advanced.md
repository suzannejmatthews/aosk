# Getting to Know the Raspberry Pi - Advanced

The Raspberry Pi is a _single board computer_ \(or SBC\), where the entirety of the computer is printed on 
a single circuit board. You can think of the Raspberry Pi as a _mini_ computer. It has enough resources to 
allow the user to do basic activities such as writing documents, and surfing the Internet.  We will use 
the Rapsberry Pi as our main computer for the exercises we will be doing in this book. 

The Raspberry Pi has a lot of the same parts that you may recognize from other computers that you've 
interacted with. One reason the Raspberry Pi is so affordable is that a lot of these components are a lot 
less powerful than those you find desktops and laptops. Let's take a closer look at the Raspberry Pi:

* **USB port:** these ports are used to connect input devices, such as a mouse or a keyboard.
* **HDMI port:**  used to connect a monitor to the Pi
* **microUSB port:** this is the port where we connect the power cable
* **Ethernet port:** used to connect the Pi to the internet or another computer. 
* **GPIO pins:** useful for interfacing with hardware. We won't use those in these tutorials.
In addition, the Raspberry Pi has integrated wireless and Bluetooth. That means you can connect to the 
internet via a wireless access point, or connect the Pi wirelessly to Bluetooth-enabled devices.

The center black chip is referred to as a _system on a chip_ (or SoC). It houses the Raspberry Pi's 
**Central Processing Unit** (or CPU) along with its **Random Access Memory** (RAM). The CPU allows the 
Pi to perform arithmetic on instructions and data. The RAM stores instructions and data that the CPU 
is actively working on. Together, the CPU and RAM of the SoC represent the Raspberry Pi's "brain".

The data that is stored in the CPU and RAM disappears when you power off your Raspberry Pi. In other 
words, the data stored in the SoC represents _temporary_ storage. The amount of data that can fit 
in the memory of the SoC is also limited. Just like humans write things on paper to remember them later, 
computers write their long-term files and data into _permanent_ storage known as the **hard 
drive**. Unlike the memory on the SoC, the data on the hard drive does not disappear when you power off
your device.

The hard drive of our Raspberry Pi is the tiny microSD card. This microSD card also houses the 
**operating system** (or OS), which is a software layer that sits between the hardware components and 
user applications. Examples of user applications include word processing tools, web browsers, 
and games.


Your Raspberry Pi is a fully functioning computer. That means when you boot it up, you would see a Desktop
environment, just like when you boot up a laptop! At this point, if you have a separate HDMI enabled monitor, 
a USB keyboard and USB mouse that you can connect your Pi, you can plug those in, power up your Pi, and 
log in. The username is `root` and the password is `toor`.
If you can succesfully log in at this point,
congratulations! You are now ready to move on to the fun part! Click [here](#ready-to-go) to continue.
