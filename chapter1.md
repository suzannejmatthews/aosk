# About the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a _single board computer_ \(or SBC\), where the entirety of the computer is printed on a single circuit board. We will use the Rapsberry Pi as our main computer for the exercises we will be doing in this book. Let's take a closer look at the Raspberry Pi:

You can think of the RaspberryPi as a _mini_ computer. It has enough resources to allow the user to do 
basic activities such as writing documents, and surfing the internet.  

The Raspberry Pi has a lot of the same parts that you may recognize from other computers that you've 
interacted with. One reason the Raspberry Pi is so affordable is that a lot of these components are a lot 
less powerful than those:

* **USB ports:** these ports are used to connect input devices, such as a mouse or a keyboard.
* **HDMI port:**  used to connect a monitor to the Pi
* **microUSB port:** this is the port where we connect the power cable
* **Ethernet port:** used to connect the Pi to a laptop/desktop. 
* **GPIO pins:** useful for interfacing with hardware. We won't use those in these tutorials.

The center black chip is referred to as a _system on a chip_ (or SoC). It houses the Raspberry Pi's 
**Central Processing Unit** (or CPU) along with its **Random Access Memory** (RAM). The SoC represents the 
Raspberry Pi's "brain". The RAM acts as the "memory", storing information that the Raspberry Pi working on, 
with the CPU performing calculations on that information.

Long-term files and data 



The operating system is on a microSD card, which makes the Pi very flexible and easy to repair. 
	Initially, a user has to connect the Pi to a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse in order to configure it. In this tutorial, the image I created allows the students to skip this step. The tutorial focuses on how to connect to the Pi using just the user's computer.
